# BasicMath

This is Hrithika's basic math repository. I am in Primary 6 studying in Clementi Primary School. 
This repository contains programs in the language of Python. The purpose of this repository is to explore Python for basic Math and Logical Reasoning.
To execute programs from this repository, you have to do the following steps
STEP 1: DOWNLOAD THE FILE
STEP 2: OPEN A COMMAND LINE WHERE THE FILE IS LOCATED
STEP 3: PYTHON <FILENAME>
  ^^^MAKE SURE YOU HAVE *PYTHON* INSTALLED ON YOUR DEVICE^^^ :)
